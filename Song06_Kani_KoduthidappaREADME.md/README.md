This joyful call echoes Galatians 5:22–23 — the ninefold fruit of the Spirit: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such things there is no law. The song urges every believer — brother, sister, young and old — to crucify fleshly desires and let the Spirit produce abundant, eternal fruit for the Kingdom.
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Holy Spirit, divine Gardener,
prune us, fill us, cause Your fruit to grow abundantly in our lives.
Let love, joy, and peace overflow.
Crucify our fleshly desires.
Make us vessels of Your ninefold fruit
for the glory of Jesus Christ.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
