This song celebrates Revelation 21 — the descent of the New Jerusalem, the renewal of heaven and earth, and the end of all tears, death, and pain. Jesus Himself declares, “Behold, I make all things new.” The old creation passes away; the bride (His people) dwells with Him forever. We sing in anticipation of that glorious day when sorrow is no more and God is all in all.
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, Maker of all things new,
come quickly and bring Your new heaven and new earth.
Wipe away every tear from our eyes.
Renew us as Your bride.
Let us dwell with You forever.
We worship You alone.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
