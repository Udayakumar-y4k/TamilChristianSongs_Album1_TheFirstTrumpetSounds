Arise, O come, with hearts ablaze!
For a thousand years, His reign we’ll praise!
Arise, O come, with joy proclaim!
With Jesus, our King, we’ll forever reign!
As witnesses bold for Jesus, draw near,
His sacred seal on your hearts revere.
Upon the throne, in glory He reigns,
Before His face, we’ll stand in His fame.
Come, let your name in Life’s Book be writ,
Seek Jesus, the Light, where true life is lit.
The dead He’ll raise with a mighty call,
No second death shall bind us at all.
Short Annotation / Study Note
This song celebrates Revelation 20:4–6 — the millennial reign of Christ with His resurrected saints. Those who were faithful witnesses, bearing His seal even unto death, are raised to reign with Him for a thousand years. The “second death” has no power over them. This is the first resurrection, the reward of the overcomers. We sing not as distant spectators, but as invited co-heirs, called to arise and reign with our King.
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, King of kings,
awaken us to arise and come!
Seal us with Your mark of life.
Write our names in the Book of Life.
Raise us to reign with You.
Let no second death touch us.
Come quickly and take Your throne.
We long to reign with You forever.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
